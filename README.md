# SpaceForks
Space Forks is a mobile game developed for CS2063, as a term project. Developed by Project Team 11 (Zachary Nickerson and Connor MacDonald).

Testing was done using a Pixel A4 emulator and a physical Samsung Galaxy S20. We also attempted to test using a Samsung A5. However, using this device caused the app to crash when starting the game.
